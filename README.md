## Configuration

First of all:

* You'll need a Linky (obviously) and a [Enedis account](https://espace-client-connexion.enedis.fr/auth/UI/Login?realm=particuliers)
* Logged in your Enedis account, you have to activate option *Courbe de charge* in order to get your hourly consumption

Then, go parameter page to:

* Fill your Enedis account and validate it
* Choose a meteo station and validate it

That's it, now wait some days to see data appear !
