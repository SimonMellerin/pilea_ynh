> *This package allows you to install Pilea quickly and simply on a YunoHost server.
If you don't have YunoHost, please consult [the guide](https://yunohost.org/#/install) to learn how to install it.*

**Warning : Due to Enedis website update, Pilea is not working anymore.**
A new version of Pilea (named [æneria](https://gitlab.com/aeneria/aeneria-app)) is under active developpement but is not fully functionnal right now.
When æneria will be ready, due to breaking change between Pilea and æneria, a new yunohost package (aeneria_ynh) will be developed. Data transfer will be available in order to  migrate from Pilea to æneria.

## Overview
The idea of [Pilea](https://gitlab.com/pilea/Pilea) is to display electricity consumption and weather data on a little dashboard that allow the user to:

 * Better understand his electricity consumption
 * Analyse his electricity consumption throw weather data

 **Shipped version:** 0.5.8

## Configuration

First of all:

* You'll need a Linky (obviously) and a [Enedis account](https://espace-client-connexion.enedis.fr/auth/UI/Login?realm=particuliers)
* Logged in your Enedis account, you have to activate option *Courbe de charge* in order to get your hourly consumption

Then, go parameter page to:

* Fill your Enedis account and validate it
* Choose a meteo station and validate it

That's it, now wait some days to see data appear!
